# Student-Tracker-App
This is a basic CRUD application that tracks students from a fictional University. It was made using JSP,Servlets and JDBC to connect to a MySQL database.

This application helped me understand the MVC architecture and how to create a simple web application using Java.

# Features
* Basic CRUD operations on students.
* A homepage that redirects to the main application.
* Search feature to search for students in the database
* Sort feature to sort students by either first name, last name or email.
